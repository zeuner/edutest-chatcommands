# EDUtest chatcommands

The goal of the EDUtest project is to facilitate the usage of Minetest
in an educational context.

This mod provides chatcommands for the educational staff.

## setup

The commands expect teacher(s) to be marked with the "teacher" privilege.

If you want to use the "student" privilege as it behaved in previous
versions of EDUtest, you will also have to install the
"edutest_student_privilege" mod ([1]).
